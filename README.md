# StrawNestSEO CMS
This is a tweaked update to the excellent StrawNestCMS micro cms platform (https://github.com/strawfervor/StrawNestCMS).

I have added various SEO benefits such as re-written urls, and for pages to have the correct seo tags, such as the title being the same as the H1 tag for that page.

I also added the ability for someone to add H2 and H3 tags in a page by starting a line with ## or // accordingly.

I LOVE micro platforms that have just a few files, and StrawNestCMS was the best tiny platform that I found, but was just lacking some SEO features.

Below is the original readme.md for StrawNestCMS.
